 1. An internet connection is required to properly get the fonts of the main-menu from google fonts
  
 2. The music file was to big to be put on github so a compressed & split version was uploaded in the `res/music` directory. To regenerate it, you just need to to go in the `res/music` directory and unzip the `professor-layton-the-toy-car-extended.zip` archive with 7zip, winrar... like if it was a normal archive.
( or just download the executable in the release. )
