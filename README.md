## Run the game

- **Windows**: Download the executable from the release

- **Linux**:  
    If `unzip` isn't installed, install it.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/David-Kyrat/CS108_Project-tCHu.git
    cd CS108_Project-tCHu
    make merge_split_jar
    make run # Aftewards, only run this command to launch the game
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> <ins>NB:</ins>  
> 1. An internet connection is required to properly get the fonts of the main-menu from google fonts
>  
> 2. The music file was to big to be put on github so a compressed & split
>    version was uploaded in the `res/music` directory. To regenerate it, 
> unzip the `professor-layton-the-toy-car-extended.zip` archive in the `res/music`
> directory
